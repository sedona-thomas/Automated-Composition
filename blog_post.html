<h1>Automated Composition with Markov Chains</h1>

<h4>Sedona Thomas</h4>

<p>
    This program automatically composes a tune from an input tune. By default,
    it plays Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, but it also accepts a sequence of
    notes, a note length, and a sequence length from the user. To start, users
    can click the play button or input a tune before clicking play.
</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>
    Markov Chains are a way to model patterns in the changes from one state to
    another. This program uses calculates the probability that a given note will
    be followed by every other note, order n steps away. Once the linklihood of
    each transition from one note to the next is calculated, the model randomly
    generates future notes based on those probabilities and adds them to the end
    of the input tune.
</p>

<p>
    Once the new note sequence has been generated, WebAudio oscillators are used to
    play the notes for the specified duration. There are numerous variations that
    can be enabled by selecting different modes, waveforms, and parameters. These
    choices do not affect the generated note sequences, only how they sound when
    played.
</p>

<h2>Design Process</h2>

<p>
    I began by designing a Markov Chain for Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and ensured
    that all of the transitions properly selected a random note, weighted by the
    occurrance probabilities. Then, I added the digital synthesizer on top of the
    Markov Chain output. Finally, I added inputs for the user to define their own
    tunes (note sequence, note length, and generated sequence length).
</p>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>

<p>
    I attempted to add MIDI file functionality to the program, but I ran into some
    issues importing the blobToNoteSequence function. Regardless, I designed the
    program to easily allow for future MIDI inputs by simply updating the current
    training data variable (same process as user inputted note sequences).
</p>

<h2>Try It Out!</h2>

<p>
    Input a sequence of notes and note length, or just hit play. You can also
    choose from various modes of the digital synthesizer by adjusting the
    available parameters before hitting play.
